### Programming languages I have experience with

#### Python
I choose to learn python because it appeared to be the most applicable coding language for my field of study (Integrated Science and Technology). Python will be helpful within my major as it is a friendly language for beginners and it can adapt to fill many purposes such as data science and software development. 

#### R and Rstudio 
I am learning this programming for my statistics class, however, this language is extemely usesful for data analysis. Learning a programming language that can import and interpret data will help me later in life to be able to calculate and understand the data - which could be a major advantage to have over others.
